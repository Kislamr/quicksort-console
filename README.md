My C# take on the quicksort algorithm

Quick description of the quicksort algorithm:

It sorts a list of values using recursion by splitting the list in lower and higher values,
the lower values recursively are sorted as well as the higher values ultimatly leading into a
completely sorted list!

It is an exquisitly wonderful thoughtout algorithm.
